## faults:

in the demo above we see some of the best sides of our naive-bayes classifer! Unfortunately this program is not always consistent and still contains inaccuracies in it's classifications. 
Although this program is surely better than random, it definitely has room for improvement! One of the ways we can improve this program is by simply feeding it more data!
More specifically, larger quantities of 'benign' data and more specific keywords for 'hostile' data.
